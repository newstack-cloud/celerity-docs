The Celerity runtime supports WebSocket applications, allowing you to build real-time applications that can scale horizontally across multiple instances. This document describes the protocol used by the Celerity runtime to handle WebSocket connections and messages.

## Message Formats

The Celerity runtime supports two types of messages for WebSocket applications:

1. **JSON Text Messages**: Text containing a JSON object that must have a configured route key that will be defined for an application. The route key defaults to `event` if it is not specified in the application configuration.
2. **Binary Messages**: These messages will be in the [Celerity Binary Message Format](/docs/framework/applications/resources/celerity-api#celerity-binary-message-format) which is prefixed with route information followed by the payload that will be forwarded to handlers.

These formats are important for messages sent from the client to the server so that the runtime can correctly route the messages to the appropriate handlers.
For server-to-client messages, the only limitation is that reserved object keys and binary prefixes can not be used for application level messages, other than that, the message format can be any text or binary data that the client application can handle.

### Reserved JSON Keys

The following top-level object keys are reserved for the Celerity runtime and should not be used in application level messages:

- `ping`: This top-level object key is used for heartbeat messages sent from the client to the server to check if the connection is still alive.
- `pong`: This top-level object key is used for heartbeat messages sent from the server to the client to acknowledge that the connection is still alive.

### Reserved Binary Prefixes

The following binary prefixes are reserved for the Celerity runtime and should not be used in application level messages:

- `[0x1 0x1 0x0 0x0]`: This binary prefix is used for ping messages.
- `[0x1 0x2 0x0 0x0]`: This binary prefix is used for pong messages.
- `[0x1 0x3 0x0 0x0]`: This binary prefix is used for informing clients of potentially lost messages.
- `[0x1 0x4 0x0 0x0]`: This binary prefix is used for acknowledging messages.

The first byte of the binary prefix indicates the length of the route key (1 byte).
The second byte indicates the route key itself (in this case, a single byte indicating the type of message).
The third byte is for whether or not the message requires an acknowledgement, this is `0x0` for all reserved messages as they do not require an acknowledgement.
The fourth byte is for the length of the message ID, which is `0` for these reserved messages as they do not have a message ID.

To avoid conflicts with these reserved prefixes, binary messages from the server to the client should use a different prefix following the Celerity Binary Message Format, which includes the length of the route key, followed by the custom route key and the message payload. For example, a binary message with a route key of `my_route` and a payload of `[0x1 0x3 0x6 0x9 0x1]` would look like this:

```plaintext
[0x8 utf8_encode(my_route)... 0x0 0x0 0x1 0x3 0x6 0x9 0x1]
```

Where `0x8` is the length of the route key (8 bytes for `my_route`), the first `0x0` indicates that the message does not require an acknowledgement and the second `0x0` after the route key indicates that there is no message ID for this message. You may also use a message ID if you want to track messages at the application level, in which case the message would look like this:

```plaintext
[0x8 utf8_encode(my_route)... 0x0 0x5 utf8_encode("12345") 0x1 0x3 0x6 0x9 0x1]
```

Where `0x5` is the length of the message ID (5 bytes for `12345`).

There are utils available for clients to parse messages in the Celerity Binary Message Format.

### Custom Message IDs

Clients and server-side applications should be able to define custom message IDs that allow for a deeper integration with the application layer, this is especially useful for handling lost messages where the message ID in the "lost message" notification refers to something that the application can use to take appropriate action.

For JSON messages, the message ID can be included in the message body as the top-level `messageId` key, for example:

```json
{
  "messageId": "12345",
  "event": "myEvent",
  "data": {
    "key": "value"
  }
}
```

For binary messages, the message ID can be included after the route key in the [Celerity Binary Message Format](/docs/framework/applications/resources/celerity-api#celerity-binary-message-format).

An example for a binary message would be:

```plaintext
[0x8 utf8_encode(my_route)... 0x0 0x5 utf8_encode("12345")... <payload>]
```

Where `0x5` is the length of the message ID (5 bytes for `12345`).

## Authentication

The WebSocket Runtime Protocol supports two approaches for authenticating WebSocket connections: `authMessage` and `connect`.
The protocol does not determine how the authentication is performed, only the way in which the authentication information is extracted and how it protects the WebSocket connection.
The process of authenticating the extracted token is determined by the configuration of the `celerity/api` resource in the application blueprint.

### `authMessage` approach

The `authMessage` approach allows the client to establish a WebSocket connection without any authentication information. Once the connection is established, the client must send an authentication message to the server to authenticate the connection.

On a successful connection, the client must send a message with token in the format:

```json
{
    "event": "authenticate",
    "data": {
        "token": "..."
    }
}
```
This is an example where the `$.data.token` field is configured as the source of the authentication token in the `celerity/api` resource configuration.

`event` in this example is the route key that the server will use to route the message to the authentication handler. When you specify a custom route key, that will be expected instead of `event`.

Upon successful authentication, the client will receive a message with the event `authenticated` in the following format:

```json
{
    "event": "authenticated",
    "data": {
        "success": true,
        "userInfo": {
            "id": "12345",
            "name": "John Doe"
        },
        "message": "Authenticated successfully"
    }
}
```

Upon failed authentication, the client will receive a message with the event `authenticated` in the following format:

```json
{
    "event": "authenticated",
    "data": {
        "success": false,
        "message": "Authentication failed"
    }
}
```

After sending the failed authentication message, the connection will be closed from the server-side. The purpose of sending the failed authentication message is to provide a clear reason for failure to the client before closing the connection, this is essential in environments that do not support custom WebSocket status codes.

the `event` field in the response message is not related to the route key, this will always be event.

The client SDKs will implement this behaviour automatically if configured for the `authMessage` approach, exposing callbacks for successful and failed authentication.

### `connect` approach

The `connect` approach allows the client to send authentication information as part of the WebSocket connection request. This is done by including the authentication token as a HTTP header in the WebSocket connection request.

Upon successful authentication, the connection will be upgraded to WebSockets and the client will be able to send and receive messages.

After upgrading the connection, the server should also send a message to the client with the event `authenticated` in the following format:

```json
{
    "event": "authenticated",
    "data": {
        "success": true,
        "userInfo": {
            "id": "12345",
            "name": "John Doe"
        },
        "message": "Authenticated successfully"
    }
}
```

Upon failed authentication/authorisation, the connection will be closed with either the custom status code `4001` (Unauthorized) or `4002` (Forbidden). The client should handle these status codes as authentication or authorisation failures respectively.
The custom status codes are in the range reserved for application-specific status codes, see [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.2) for more information..

The client SDKs will implement this behaviour automatically if configured for the `connect` approach, exposing callbacks for successful and failed authentication.

## Resilience & Reconnection Behaviour

Clients of Celerity WebSocket APIs compatible with the Celerity runtime should provide reconnection behaviour and the server-side runtime should provide a way to inform clients of messages that may have been lost.

In addition to this, both client and server-side components should support opt-in acknowledgement of messages where messages are resent due to an acknowledgement timeout up to a configurable maximum number of attempts.

This protocol provides heartbeat mechanisms to help clients detect lost connections and implement reconnection logic. It also provides a way for the server to inform clients about messages that may have been lost, which is especially used in multi-node deployments of a WebSocket API.

### Heartbeats and Reconnections

Heartbeats for the WebSocket Runtime Protocol are client-driven.
A server doesn't need to instigate a heartbeat to check if the connection is alive, if a message needs to be delivered to a client that is not accessible, the message will eventually be considered lost and relevant clients will be [notified of the lost message](#lost-messages).

The client should send a ping message to the server at regular intervals to check if the connection is still alive. If the server does not respond with a pong message within a certain timeout period, the client should attempt to reconnect.

The client should allow for a configurable interval and timeout for the ping messages with retry limits and exponential backoff for reconnection attempts. The client should also handle the case where the server is temporarily unavailable and retry the connection after a certain period of time.

#### Ping and Pong Messages

Ping messages can either be binary messages or JSON messages.

The binary message must have the following content:

```plaintext
[0x1 0x1 0x0 0x0]
```

This is following the Celerity Binary Message Format, where the first byte indicates the length of the route key (1 byte) and the second byte indicates the route key itself (in this case a single byte `0x1` indicating a ping message). The third byte is `0x0` indicating that the message does not require an acknowledgement.
The fourth byte is `0x0` indicating that there is no message ID for this ping message.

The JSON message must have the following content:

```json
{
  "ping": true
}
```

Pong messages can also be either binary messages or JSON messages.

The binary message must have the following content:

```plaintext
[0x1 0x2 0x0 0x0]
```

This is following the Celerity Binary Message Format, where the first byte indicates the length of the route key (1 byte) and the second byte indicates the route key itself (in this case a single byte `0x2` indicating a pong message). The third byte is `0x0` indicating that the message does not require an acknowledgement.
The fourth byte is `0x0` indicating that there is no message ID for this pong message.

The JSON message must have the following content:

```json
{
  "pong": true
}
```

### Acknowledgements

Acknowledgements are used to ensure messages are received by the client or server.
The acknowledgement mechanism is opt-in and will only apply to messages that are sent with a message ID.

#### Messages

To opt-in to acknowledgements, the client or server-side application must specify in the message that the sender is expecting an acknowledgement for the message.

For JSON messages, the message must have the following format:

```json
{
  "ack": true
}
```

For binary messages, the message must have the following form:

```plaintext
[0x3 utf8_encode("123")... 0x1 0x2 utf8_encode("10") 0x1 0x5 0x3 0x3 0x1]
```

Where:

- `0x3` is the length of the route key (3 bytes for `123`).
- `utf8_encode("123")` is the route key itself.
- `0x1` indicates that the message requires an acknowledgement.
- `0x2` is the length of the message ID (2 bytes for `10`).
- `utf8_encode("10")` is the message ID.
- `[0x1 0x5 0x3 0x3 0x1]` is the payload.

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
If a message ID is not present, the flag to opt in to acknowledgements will be ignored.
</Callout>


Acknowledgement messages are in the form of a binary message with the following format:

```plaintext
[0x1 0x4 0x0 0x0 utf8_encode("{"messageId":"<messageId>","timestamp":"<timestamp>"}")...]
```

Where:

- `0x1` is the length of the route key (1 byte).
- `0x4` is the route key itself (in this case a single byte `0x4` indicating an acknowledgement message).
- The first `0x0` indicates that the message does not require an acknowledgement.
- The second `0x0` is the length of the message ID (0 bytes, as this is a reserved message).
- `utf8_encode("{"messageId":"<messageId>","timestamp":"<timestamp>"}")` is the JSON-encoded message that contains the ID of the message that has been acknowledged and the timestamp of the acknowledgement.

#### Client Requested Acknowledgements

When a message is sent from the server to the client, the client will need to listen for an acknowledgement that the message has been received by the server. The server will then send an acknowledgement message to the client with the message ID and the timestamp of the acknowledgement.

The client will need to track the status of the message and if an acknowledgement has not been received after a configurable timeout, the client will need to resend the message up to a configurable maximum number of attempts. The client should delay resending the message until the next heartbeat pong is received from the server, and then proceed to resend the message once there is confirmation that the connection is still alive.

If after a configurable number of attempts, an acknowledgement has not been received, the client should consider the message lost and inform the application layer to take appropriate action.

This behaviour will be handled by the client SDKs, exposing appropriate callbacks to the application layer to notify the application of the current status of the message and allow it to handle the case of a lost message.

When responding to a message that requires an acknowledgement, the server should send an acknowledgement message to the client with the message ID and the timestamp of the acknowledgement upon receiving the message.
There is no special behaviour needed for multi-node deployments for client-requested acknowledgements. This is because server nodes do not act as gateways to forward messages from clients to other nodes, the application layer is responsible for calling `send_message` or equivalent on the server-side to forward messages to clients connected that may be connected to other nodes.

#### Server Requested Acknowledgements

When a message is sent from the client to the server, the server will need to listen for an acknowledgement that the message has been received by the client. The client is then expected to send an acknowledgement message to the server with the message ID and the timestamp of the acknowledgement.

The server will need to track the status of the message in-memory and if an acknowledgement has not been received after a configurable timeout, the server will need to resend the message up to a configurable maximum number of attempts. When the client has disconnected, the server should consider the message lost as client sessions are not persisted at the runtime protocol layer, a client is tracked by the connection ID which only lasts the lifetime of a single connection.

### Lost Messages

Lost messages must be taken into account for messages sent from the server to the client.
Applications deployed on the Celerity runtime will want to send messages to multiple clients, either to forward messages from one client to others in a shared session, channel or room, or to send messages to clients that are listening for a specific event that occurs on the server.

In multi-node deployments, messages sent from the server to a specific client via a connection ID will often be sent across different nodes in the cluster via a network protocol, which can lead to messages being lost if there is an issue with the network or a node failure.
There is also the case where a message sent from the server-side application to a client is lost due to the client disconnecting due to network issues or other reasons.

For these cases, a mechanism must be provided to inform specific clients connected to the current node of messages that may have been lost, so that the client can take appropriate action, such as asking the user to retry the action that caused the message to be sent. The responsibility of retrying actions and content-based deduplication is left to the application logic both client and server-side.

The Celerity runtime provides 2 ways of handling lost messages:

1. Synchronous server-side error handling when using the SDK to send messages to clients, the `waitForAck` or similarly named option can be used to wait for an acknowledgement that the client has received the message in a multi-node deployment. This option is only required for multi-node deployments, in a single node deployment, if the target client is not connected to the server, an immediate lost message error will be returned.
2. Asynchronous client-side handling of lost messages, where the server-side application code sending a message to a specific client can use an `informClientsOnLoss` or similarly named option to provide a list of clients (connection IDs) that should be informed if the message is considered lost. In this case, the runtime will send a message to the specified clients (if they are connected to the current node) with a message indicating that the message may have been lost allowing the client to take appropriate action.


Lost messages are sent to clients using a binary message of the following format:

```plaintext
[0x1 0x3 0x0 0x0 utf8_encode("{"messageId":"<messageId>","caller":"<caller>"}")...]
```

Where:
- `0x1` is the length of the route key (1 byte).
- `0x3` is the route key itself (in this case a single byte `0x3` indicating a lost message).
- The first `0x0` indicates that the message does not require an acknowledgement.
- The second `0x0` is the length of the message ID (0 bytes, as this is a reserved message).
- `utf8_encode("{"messageId":"<messageId>","caller":"<caller>"}")` is the JSON-encoded message that contains the ID of the message that may have been lost and an ID for the caller context. When an application-defined message ID is provided on the server-side attempt to send the message, this may correspond to a persisted ID at the application level that can be used by the client when taking appropriate action. If the message ID is generated by the runtime, then it won't be very useful to the client, and the caller ID should instead be used to identify the context or purpose of the message.

When it comes to messages sent from the client to the server, as clients send messages directly to the server that they are intended for, the only way a message can be lost is if there is a network issue or the server is temporarily unavailable. In this case, the client should handle the reconnection logic and retry sending the message after a certain period of time. The client SDKs will provide a way to handle the reconnection automatically but the application logic needs to determine what messages to retry (if any) after a reconnection.

## Deduplication

Both client and server-side components should provide a way to handle message deduplication based on the message ID. When the client or server does not provide a message ID, the runtime or client SDK will not be able to deduplicate messages, it will be the responsibility of the application layer to handle deduplication.

On the server-side, the runtime should keep track of messages that have been received from the client.
Depending on the type of deployment, the runtime will either store the message ID in a shared store or in memory. Single node deployments will use in-memory storage, cluster deployments will use a shared store. The runtime will need to check if the message ID has been received before and if so, it should not be processed again. The entries in the message ID store should expire after a configurable timeout (defaulting to 5 minutes) to prevent the shared store from growing indefinitely.

On the client-side, an in-memory store should be used to keep track of messages that have been received from the server. The client will need to check if the message ID has been received before and if so, it should not be processed again. The entries in the message ID store on the client side should also expire after a configurable timeout (defaulting to 5 minutes) to manage memory usage.

The client-side aspect of message ID deduplication will be taken care of the by the client SDKs.

## Good Defaults

The following are a set of good defaults to be used for the configurable values for the client and server-side components.

- 10 seconds for the acknowledgement timeout.
- 3 for the maximum number of attempts to resend a message.
- 5 minutes for the message ID store TTL. (For deduplication)
- 10 seconds for the heartbeat interval.
- 5 seconds for the heartbeat timeout.

## Message ID Generation

Message IDs should be generated using either UUIDs or a more compact format such as [NanoID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid). The ID should be globally random and not predictable.
