title: Celerity Versions
description: Overview of Celerity versions and feature evolution
---

Celerity is an ecosystem of multiple software components that work together to provide a unified backend development experience. The capabilities available depend on which components are implemented and to what degree.

This section provides an overview of the versioning strategy for Celerity spanning multiple software components and resource type specifications. The term "Ecosystem" is used to refer to the entire Celerity project.

## Version Strategy

### v0 (Current) - Evolving Capabilities
**Initial Release**: October 1st, 2025  
**Evolution Period**: October 2025 - September 2026

v0 represents the initial release of Celerity with limited but functional capabilities that will continuously evolve until the release of v1.

The current v0 release supports deploying Celerity applications to AWS serverless environments with application handlers running in AWS Lambda:

#### Current v0 Components (October 2025)
- **Celerity CLI**: Full set of commands for starting projects along with the development and deployment lifecycle.
- **Celerity Core Runtimes & SDKs**: Node.js and Python runtimes only, supporting HTTP APIs, WebSocket APIs, consumers and schedules. Workflows will not be supported in the initial v0 release.
- **Celerity::1**: Local development environment resources that power the CLI's development environment commands. This will only support the resource types listed in the v0 resource types section.
- **Client SDK for WebSocket APIs**: Client SDKs for browsers, Node.js and Python to interact with WebSocket APIs adhering to the [WebSocket Runtime Protocol](/docs/runtime/websocket-runtime-protocol), that are also compatible with AWS API Gateway v2 WebSocket APIs.
- [**Bluelink Deploy Engine**](https://bluelink.dev/docs/overview): The engine that powers deployments of Celerity applications, initially supporting only a subset of AWS services that enable serverless deployments.
- [**Bluelink Blueprint Language Server**](https://bluelink.dev/docs/overview): Diagnostics, validation and auto-complete support for blueprints used to define Celerity applications.

#### Current v0 Resource Types (October 2025)
- `celerity/api` - AWS API Gateway deployments and the Celerity runtime locally - HTTP and WebSocket APIs, full CORS support and authentication.
- `celerity/handler` - AWS Lambda functions
- `celerity/handlerConfig` - Helper type for shared handler configuration translating to AWS Lambda function configuration.

## Documentation Versioning Strategy

The Celerity-wide documentation uses a simple versioning approach:

### 1) Spec Version
- **Format**: `vYYYY-MM-DD-draft` (e.g., `v2025-10-01-draft`)
- **Purpose**: Single evolving specification for each resource type
- **When to update**: When a stable resource specification changes
- **Draft Status**: Will remain in draft until v1 release (September 2026)
- **Blueprint transform**: Matches the spec version

### 2) Ecosystem Compatibility
- **v0**: Current capabilities (continuously evolving)
- **v1**: Full planned capabilities (target: September 2026)
- **Purpose**: Indicates which ecosystem features are available
- **When to update**: As ecosystem components are implemented

### Example Resource Documentation Header
```markdown
# `celerity/api`

**Spec Version:** `v2025-10-01-draft`  
**Ecosystem Compatibility:** v0 (Current) / v1 (Preview)

**blueprint transform:** `celerity-2025-10-01-draft`
```

### Simple Timeline
1. **Current**: `v2025-10-01-draft` (single evolving spec)
2. **v1 Release**: `v2026-09-01` (stable, no draft suffix)

This approach allows us to:
- **Keep it simple** - Single evolving spec per resource type
- **Track current state** - Ecosystem compatibility shows what's available
- **Provide roadmap** - Users can see both current capabilities and future plans
- **Easy maintenance** - Update spec as features are added

## Migration Path

Users can start with v0 and gradually adopt new features as they become available. The documentation will be updated to reflect the current state while maintaining visibility into the full vision for v1.

### Version Indicators in Documentation

Throughout the documentation, you'll see the following indicators:
- ✅ **Available in v0** - Features currently supported
- 🔄 **Planned for v0** - Features coming in future v0 evolution
- 🚀 **Planned for v1** - Features coming in v1 release

As v0 evolves, features will gradually move from 🔄 to ✅ as they become available, and from 🚀 to 🔄 as they move from v1 plans to v0 plans.
