`index.html`

___

<FieldHeading fieldName="notFoundDocument" />

The name of the document to return when a requested object is not found in the bucket.
This is typically a custom 404 page that you can use to provide a better user experience when a requested object is not found.

For the AWS target environments, this will be used as the error document for the static website hosted in the bucket that is a catch-all for errors beyond 404 not found errors.

**field type**

string

**examples**

`404.html`

___

## Linked From

### `celerity/handler`

When a handler links out to a bucket, it will be configured with permissions and environment variables that enable the handler to interact with the bucket. If a `celerity/config` resource is associated with the handler or the application that it is a part of, the bucket configuration will be added to the config/secret store instead of environment variables. You can use guides and templates to get an intuition for how to source the configuration and interact with object storage services using the handlers SDK.

<Callout title="Opting out of the handlers SDK for buckets" type="warning">
You don't have to use the handlers SDK abstraction for buckets,
you can also grab the populated configuration directly and interact directly with the SDK for the object storage service for the chosen target environment. Doing so will require application code changes if you decide to switch target environments.
</Callout>

✅ **Available in v0**

## Links To

### `celerity/queue`

When a bucket is linked to a queue, the queue will be configured to receive notifications from the bucket for events such as object creation, deletion, and updates. This is useful for making events flow through a queue for processing by handlers in an application where the queue can be used to control the flow of events and ensure that they are processed in a reliable manner.

In cases where you deploy your application to a target environment that is not FaaS-based[^1], a queue will be used to receive notifications from the bucket that the Celerity runtime will poll for events and trigger handlers accordingly.

✅ **Available in v0**

[Read more about Celerity Queues](/docs/framework/applications/resources/celerity-queue)

### `celerity/topic`

When a bucket is linked to a topic, the topic will be configured to receive notifications from the bucket for events such as object creation, deletion, and updates. This is useful for publishing events to a topic that can be subscribed to by consumers such as handlers in applications of the `celerity/consumer` resource type.

✅ **Available in v0**

[Read more about Celerity Topics](/docs/framework/applications/resources/celerity-topic)

### `celerity/consumer`

When a bucket is linked to a consumer, the consumer will be configured to receive notifications from the bucket for events such as object creation, deletion, and updates. This is useful for processing events that can then perform actions based on the events received from the bucket.

For FaaS-based target environments, the handlers configured for the consumer will be triggered directly through a rule in the cloud provider's event system (e.g. Amazon EventBridge). To gain greater control over throughput and processing of events, you can link the bucket to a queue or topic and have the application consume events from there.

✅ **Available in v0**

[Read more about Celerity Consumers](/docs/framework/applications/resources/celerity-consumer)

### `celerity/workflow`

When a bucket is linked to a workflow, a workflow execution will be triggered when an event occurs in the bucket, such as an object being created, deleted, or updated. For FaaS-based target environments, the notification will be used to trigger an execution of the cloud provider's workflow service (e.g. AWS Step Functions). For non-FaaS target environments, an intermediary serverless function will be triggered by the bucket event to start the workflow execution by calling the API of your workflow application provided by the Celerity Workflow Runtime.

🚀 **Planned for v1** - Support for workflows is planned for v1, they may become available in a future v0 evolution.

## Storage Class Mappings

To simplify object lifecycle configuration, the concept of `hot`, `cool` and `archive` storage classes for object transitions is used for a `celerity/bucket` resource. (This is the simplified model provided by Azure Blob Storage)

Google Cloud Storage and Amazon S3 have more granular sets of storage classes. The following table shows the mapping of storage classes to the simplified model:

| Celerity Bucket Storage Class | Google Cloud Storage | Amazon S3   | Azure Blob Storage |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| hot                           |  STANDARD            | STANDARD    |  hot               |
| cool                          |  NEARLINE            | GLACIER_IR  |  cool              |
| archive                       |  ARCHIVE             | GLACIER     |  archive           |

<Callout title="Limited support in current v0" type="warning">
Only Amazon S3 is supported in the current iteration of Celerity v0.
</Callout>

## Target Environments

### Celerity::1

✅ **Available in v0**

In the Celerity::1 local environment, object storage is provided by a [minio](https://min.io/) instance running on a container network on the local or CI machine.
Replication and encryption configuration will be ignored in the Celerity::1 environment.

Bucket notifications are published from the minio instance to a [valkey](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey) queue on the local or CI machine using the [Redis bucket notification](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/administration/monitoring/publish-events-to-redis.html) support in minio. The runtime will poll the queue for notifications and trigger handlers in response to bucket events.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
[valkey](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey) is also used as the `celerity/queue` and `celerity/topic` implementation in Celerity::1, so the same behaviour is mostly reused for bucket notifications.
</Callout>

<Callout title="No encryption in local & CI environments" type="warning">
Buckets are not encrypted in local & CI environment.
</Callout>

### AWS

✅ **Available in v0**

In AWS, the `celerity/bucket` resource is implemented using [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets.

When replication is enabled, Celerity will create a replication configuration for the bucket with a simple rule to replicate objects to the specified regions.
A bucket resource will be created in each of the specified regions in the same storage class as the primary bucket.

Prefix-based replication is not supported in AWS, so all objects in the bucket will be replicated to the specified regions.

If enabling replication for an existing bucket, you will need to initiate a batch replication job to copy existing objects to the replicated buckets, Celerity (or the underlying S3 service) will not automatically copy existing objects to the replicated buckets.

### Google Cloud

🚀 **Planned for v1** - The Google Cloud deployment target is planned for v1, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

In Google Cloud, the `celerity/bucket` resource is implemented using [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) buckets.

When replication is enabled, Celerity will create a dual-region replication configuration for the bucket with the region for the deployment of the bucket and a single region to replicate to.

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
When more than one region is specified for replication, only the first region will be used, as Celerity only supports dual-region replication for Google Cloud Storage buckets.
</Callout>

### Azure

🚀 **Planned for v1** - The Azure deployment target is planned for v1, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

In Azure, the `celerity/bucket` resource is implemented using [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/).

When replication is enabled, Celerity will create a replication configuration for the container with a simple rule to replicate objects to the specified regions.

A storage account will be created in each of the specified regions, and the container will be created in each of the storage accounts. A replication policy will be created to replicate objects to the configured regions.

Prefix-based replication is not supported in Azure Blob Storage, so all objects in the container will be replicated to the specified regions.

When updating an existing bucket with replication enabled, Celerity will set a `minCreationTime` (based on the time the container was created) on the replication policy to ensure existing and new objects are replicated to the specified regions.

<Callout title="Azure supports up to 2 regions for replication" type="warning">
When more than two regions are specified for replication, only the first two regions will be used, as Azure Blob Storage only supports replication to two regions (storage accounts).
</Callout>

## App Deploy Configuration

Configuration specific to a target environment can be defined for `celerity/bucket` resources in the [app deploy configuration](/docs/cli/app-deploy-configuration) file.

This section lists the configuration options that can be set in the `deployTarget.config` object in the app deploy configuration file.

### AWS Configuration Options

✅ **Available in v0**

#### aws.s3.replication.role

The IAM role to assume when replicating objects in an S3 bucket.

**Type**

string

**Deploy Targets**

`aws`, `aws-serverless`

**Default Value**

When not provided, a role to assume will be created automatically when the bucket is created.

**Example**

```javascript
{

    "name": "aws",
    "appEnv": "production",
    "config": {
      "aws.s3.replication.role": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-replication-role"
    }
  }
}
```

#### aws.s3.\<bucketName\>.replication.role

The IAM role to assume when replicating objects in an S3 bucket with a specific name.
`<bucketName>` refers to the logical name (key) of the bucket resource in the blueprint, not the actual name of the bucket in the target environment.

**Type**

string

**Deploy Targets**

`aws`, `aws-serverless`

**Default Value**

When not provided, a role to assume will be created automatically when the bucket is created.

**Example**

{
  "deployTarget": {
    "name": "aws",
    "appEnv": "production",
    "config": {
      "aws.s3.myAppBucket.replication.role": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-replication-role"
    }
  }
}
```

[^1]: FaaS stands for Function-as-a-Service, which is a serverless compute model where applications are composed of functions that are triggered by events. Examples of FaaS include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions and Azure Functions.
