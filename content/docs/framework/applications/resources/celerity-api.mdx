**Spec Version:** `v2026-02-27-draft`  
**Ecosystem Compatibility:** v0 (Current) / v1 (Preview)

**blueprint transform:** `celerity-2026-02-27-draft`

<Callout title="Ecosystem Compatibility" type="info">
- **v0 (Current)**: AWS only, supporting AWS API Gateway and Lambda deployments.
- **v1 (Preview)**: Multi-cloud with support for deployment as containerised applications as well as FaaS deployments.

Read more about Celerity versions [here](/docs/framework/versions).
</Callout>

The `celerity/api` resource type is used to define an HTTP API or a WebSocket API.

An API can be deployed to different target environments such as a Serverless API Gateway[^1], a containerised environment, or a custom server.

Containerised environments and custom servers use the Celerity runtime for the language of choice to be deployed to handle incoming requests and route them to your [application handlers](/docs/applications/resources/celerity-handler).
The Celerity deploy engine and platforms built on top of it will take care of this for the supported target environments (e.g. Amazon ECS).

## Specification

The specification is the structure of the resource definition that comes under the `spec` field of the resource in a blueprint.
The rest of this section lists fields that are available to configure the `celerity/api` resource followed by examples of different configurations for the resource and how the API behaves in target environments along with additional documentation.

<Callout title="Feature Availability" type="info">
- ✅ **Available in v0** - Features currently supported
- 🔄 **Planned for v0** - Features coming in future v0 evolution
- 🚀 **Planned for v1** - Features coming in v1 release
</Callout>

### protocols (required)

A list of protocols that the API supports.
A Celerity API can support HTTP or WebSocket protocols.
Multiple protocols for the same API are supported in certain cases. An API can be both an HTTP and WebSocket API. In a Serverless environment this will map to multiple API Gateways in most cases, in a custom server or containerised environment this will map to a hybrid server that handles both protocols.

✅ **HTTP protocol** - Available in v0

✅ **WebSocket protocol** - Available in v0

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
The "websocket" protocol is not supported in Serverless environments for Google Cloud and Azure.
"Serverless environments" in this context refers to environments where handlers are deployed as serverless functions (e.g. AWS Lambda).
</Callout>

**type**

array[( "http" | "websocket" | [websocketNamedConfiguration](#websocketnamedconfiguration) )]

### cors

## Annotations

Annotations define additional metadata that can determine the behaviour of the resource in relation to other resources in the blueprint or to add behaviour to a resource that is not in its spec.

### `celerity/api`

The following are a set of annotations that are specific to the `celerity/api` resource type.
These annotations are nothing to do with relationships between resources, but are used to configure the behaviour of the api.

<FieldHeading fieldName="celerity.app" />

Provides a way to group application components together that are a part of the same application.
This is especially useful when deploying to a containerised or custom server environment as it allows you to combine consumers, schedules and APIs into a single deployed application.

✅ **Available in v0** - This annotation is available in v0.

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
Only **_one_** API can be a part of a single application.
</Callout>

**type**

string
___

### `celerity/vpc` 🔗 `celerity/api`

The following are a set of annotations that determine the behaviour of the API in relation to a VPC.
Appropriate security groups are managed by the VPC to API link.

When a VPC is not defined for the container-backed AWS, Google Cloud and Azure target environments, the default VPC for the account will be used.

VPC annotations and links do not have any effect for serverless environments.
Serverless APIs are managed by the cloud provider and are not deployed to a customer-managed VPC,
only handlers can be deployed to VPCs in serverless environments.

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
When a VPC is not defined for container-backed cloud environments, annotations in the `celerity/api` will apply to the default VPC for the account.
</Callout>

<FieldHeading fieldName="celerity.api.vpc.subnetType" />

The kind of subnet that the API should be deployed to.

🚀 **Planned for v1** - This annotation will be applicable when APIs can be deployed to a containerised environment, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

**type**

string

**allowed values**

`public` | `private`

**default value**

`public` - When a VPC links to an API, the API will be deployed to a public subnet.

___

<FieldHeading fieldName="celerity.api.vpc.lbSubnetType" />

The kind of subnet that the load balancer for an API should be deployed to.
This is only relevant when the API is deployed to an environment that requires load balancers to run the API.

🚀 **Planned for v1** - This annotation will be applicable when APIs can be deployed to containerised environments that support load balancers, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

**type**

string

**allowed values**

`public` | `private`

**default value**

`public` - When a VPC links to an API, the load balancer for the API will be deployed to a public subnet.

## Outputs

Outputs are computed values that are accessible via the `{resourceName}.spec.*` field accessor in a blueprint substitution.
For example, if the resource name is `myApi`, the output would be accessible via `${myApi.spec.id}`.

### id

The ID of the created API in the target environment.
For customer server or containerised environments, this will be the same as the `baseUrl` output field.

**type**

string

**examples**

`arn:aws:apigateway:us-east-1::/apis/1234567890` (AWS Serverless)

`projects/123456789/locations/global/apis/api-abc` (Google Cloud Serverless)

`https://api.example.com/v1` (Custom Server or Containerised Environment)


### baseUrl

The base URL of the deployed API.

**type**

string

**examples**

`https://api.example.com/v1`

`https://abcdef.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` (AWS Serverless)

`https://my-gateway-a12bcd345e67f89g0h.uc.gateway.dev` (Google Cloud Serverless)

## Data Types

**field type**

[websocketConfiguration](#websocketconfiguration)
___

### websocketConfiguration

Configuration for the WebSocket protocol of an API.

<FieldsHeading />

<FieldHeading fieldName="routeKey" />

The key in the message JSON object to use for routing messages to the correct handler.
This is not used for binary messages, only for text WebSocket messages.
For binary messages, the route is extracted from the prefix of the message as per the [Celerity Binary Message Format](#celerity-binary-message-format).

**field type**

string

**default value**

`event`

___

<FieldHeading fieldName="authStrategy" />

Determines the strategy for authenticating WebSocket connections.
When `authMessage` is set, the client is expected to send a message with an authentication token to authenticate the connection.
When `connect` is set, the client is expected to send the authentication token in the connection request headers.

See the [WebSocket Auth Strategy](#websocket-auth-strategy) section for more information.

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
In Serverless environments that support WebSocket APIs, only the `authMessage` strategy is supported.
This is because custom WebSocket status codes are not supported by Serverless WebSocket API offerings.
</Callout>

**field type**

string

**allowed values**

`authMessage` | `connect`

**default value**

`authMessage`

___

<FieldHeading fieldName="authGuard (conditionally required)" />

The name of the auth guard in the API's auth guard map to use for every new WebSocket connection established by clients.
This is required when the `authStrategy` field is set.

<FieldsHeading />

<FieldHeading fieldName="domainName (required)" />

The custom domain name to use for the API.

**field type**

string

**examples**

`api.example.com`

___

<FieldHeading fieldName="basePaths" />

A list of base paths to configure for the API.
This is useful when you want to configure the same domain for multiple APIs
and route requests to different APIs based on the base path.

When providing protocol-specific base paths, only one can be provided for each protocol; additionally, protocol-specific base paths can not be mixed with simple base paths.

Hybrid APIs that support both HTTP and WebSocket protocols **must** have protocol-specific base paths defined.

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
When deploying a Celerity application to a custom server or containerised environment,
the base path is used by a reverse proxy or load balancer to route a request to the correct upstream service
for a domain that hosts multiple APIs or applications.
In a simple set up, the base path should be stripped from the request URL before it reaches the runtime router.

Simple examples where base path should be stripped:

`["/"]`

`["/api/current", "/api/v1"]`

When multiple base paths are provided for different protocols, the reverse proxy or load balancer
must **not** strip the base path from the request URL.
The presence of the base path in the request allows the runtime router to determine whether to route the request to a HTTP or WebSocket handler.

Advanced example where base path should **not** be stripped:

```yaml
- protocol: "http"
  basePath: "/api"
- protocol: "websocket"
  basePath: "/ws"
```
</Callout>

**field type**

array[( string | [basePathConfiguration ](#basepathconfiguration))]

**default value**

`["/"]`

**examples**

```yaml
- protocol: "http"
  basePath: "/api"
- protocol: "websocket"
  basePath: "/ws"
```

___

<FieldHeading fieldName="normalizeBasePath" />

When set to `true`, the base path will be normalised to remove non-alphanumeric characters.

**field type**

boolean

**default value**

`true`

___

<FieldHeading fieldName="certificateId (required)" />

The ID of the certificate to use for the custom domain.
This is specific to the target environment where the API is deployed.
For example, in AWS, this would be the ARN of an ACM certificate.
Usually, it would be best to provide this as a variable to decouple the blueprint
from a specific target environment like a cloud provider.

**field type**

string

**examples**

`arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`

`"${variables.certificateId}"`

Supported values are `TLS_1_0` and `TLS_1_2`.

**field type**

string

**allowed values**

`TLS_1_0` | `TLS_1_2`

___

### authConfiguration

Configuration for authorization to control access to the API.

<FieldsHeading />

<FieldHeading fieldName="guards" />

A mapping of guard names to configurations that are used to control access to the API.

**field type**

mapping[string, [authGuardConfiguration](#authguardconfiguration)]

___

<FieldHeading fieldName="defaultGuard" />

The identifier of the guard that should be used as the default guard for the API.
This should only be set when you want to use the same guard for all endpoints of the API.

**field type**

string

___

### authGuardConfiguration

Configuration for a guard that is used to control access to the API.

<FieldsHeading />

<FieldHeading fieldName="type" />

The type of guard that can be used to control access to endpoints
of the API.
When the guard type is set to custom, you can implement a custom guard with a handler.
In the blueprint definition, the handler must be linked to the API with the annotation `celerity.handler.guard.custom` set to `true`.

**field type**

string

**allowed values**

`jwt` | `custom`
___

<FieldHeading fieldName="issuer (conditionally required)" />

The token issuer that is used to validate a JWT when the guard type is `jwt`.
This is required when the guard type is `jwt`, ignored otherwise.

The URL of the issuer is used to retrieve OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth2 discovery documents to verify the JWT. For example, if the issuer is `https://identity.newstack.cloud/oauth2/v1/`, the discovery document will be retrieved from `https://identity.newstack.cloud/oauth2/v1/.well-known/openid-configuration`. The type of discovery document is determined by the `discoveryMode` field.

**field type**

string

**examples**

`https://identity.newstack.cloud/oauth2/v1/`
___

<FieldHeading fieldName="discoveryMode" />

The mode of discovery to use when retrieving the OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth2 discovery documents.
This is used when the guard type is `jwt`, otherwise it will be ignored.

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
Depending on the target environment, the `oauth2` discovery mode may not be supported, serverless platforms will often only support OIDC discovery documents.
When running an API in the Celerity runtime (containerised deployments), the `oauth2` discovery mode will always be supported, meaning the `/.well-known/oauth-authorizaton-server` will be used to retrieve the discovery document.
</Callout>

**field type**

string

**allowed values**

`oidc` | `oauth2`

**default value**

`oidc`

___

<FieldHeading fieldName="tokenSource (conditionally required)" />

The source of the token in the request or message.
This is required when the guard type is `jwt`, ignored otherwise.

This is expected to be in the format `$.*` where `*` is the field in the request or message
that contains the token.
For example, in a HTTP request, a token in the `Authorization` header would be `$.headers.Authorization`.
For HTTP requests, the token sources can be `$.headers.`, `$.query.`, `$.body.`, `$.cookies.`.

In a WebSocket message a token in the message data would be `$.data.token`, assuming a message structure such as:
```json
{
    "event": "authenticate",
    "data": {
        "token": "..."
    }
}
```

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
For WebSocket APIs using the `connect` auth strategy, the token source must be in a HTTP header (`$.headers.*`), in cookies (`$.cookies.*`) or in the query string (`$.query.*`).
</Callout>

**field type**

string | array[ [valueSourceConfiguration](#valuesourceconfiguration) ]

**examples**

`$.headers.Authorization`

`$.query.token`

`$.body.token`

<FieldHeading fieldName="audience (conditionally required)" />

A list of intended recipients of a JWT.
This is required when the guard type is `jwt`, ignored otherwise.
See [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3) for more information about JWT audiences.

**field type**

array[string]

**examples**

`["https://identity.newstack.cloud/api/manage/v1/"]`

`["4f4948fac1b4b2b4c10deaf32"]` (a client ID for an OAuth2 application)

___

<FieldHeading fieldName="authScheme" />

The auth scheme of the token sourced from the request or message.
Depending on the token type, a prefix for an auth scheme will be removed from the token before it is validated.
This will default to `bearer` if not specified.

**field type**

string

**allowed values**

`bearer` | `basic` | `digest`

**default value**

`bearer`

___

### valueSourceConfiguration

Configuration for a value source used to extract values such as JWTs from a request or message.

<FieldsHeading />

<FieldHeading fieldName="protocol (required)" />

The protocol that the value source is used for.
This can be either `http` or `websocket`.

**field type**

string

**allowed values**

`http` | `websocket`
___

<FieldHeading fieldName="source (required)" />

The source of the value in the request or message.

This is expected to be in the format `$.*` where `*` is the field in the request or message
that contains the value.
For example, in a HTTP request, the `Authorization` header would be `$.headers.Authorization`.
For HTTP requests, the token sources can be `$.headers.`, `$.query.`, `$.body.`, `$.cookies.`.

In a WebSocket message, a token in the message data would be `$.data.authToken`, assuming a message structure such as:

    }
}
```

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
When the value source is for a token in a WebSocket API using the `connect` auth strategy, the token source must be in a HTTP header (`$.headers.*`), in cookies (`$.cookies.*`) or in the query string (`$.query.*`).
</Callout>

**field type**

string

**examples**

`$.headers.Authorization`

`$.query.token`

`$.cookies.authToken`

___

### basePathConfiguration

## Linked From

### `celerity/vpc`

Depending on the target environment, the API may be deployed to a VPC for private access.
When deploying to serverless environments such as AWS API Gateway, the API itself is not deployed to a VPC.

🚀 **Planned for v1** - This link will be applicable when APIs can be deployed to containerised environments, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

[Read more about Celerity VPCs](/docs/framework/applications/resources/celerity-vpc)

## Links To

### `celerity/handler`

Handlers contain the application functionality that is executed in response to an incoming request or message to an API. Annotations for the handler resource type can be used to configure the behaviour of the handler in relation to the API.

Handlers can also be custom auth guards that are used to control access to the API.

✅ **Available in v0**

[Read more about Celerity handlers](/docs/framework/applications/resources/celerity-handler)

### `celerity/config`

The `celerity/config` resource type can be used to store configuration and sensitive information such as API keys, database passwords, and other credentials that are used by the application.
An API can link to a `celerity/config` resource to access secrets and configuration at runtime, linking an application to a secret and configuration store will automatically make secrets accessible to all handlers in the application without having to link each handler to the store.

## WebSockets

### Celerity Binary Message Format

Celerity provides a binary message format that is used to route binary WebSocket messages to the correct handler.
This format is purely for messages sent from a client to the server, messages sent from the server to the client can be in any format as per the API designed for a specific application.

<Callout title="Caution" type="warning">
WebSocket binary messages are only supported by the Celerity runtime. The runtime is used when deploying a Celerity application to a custom server or a containerised environment.
</Callout>

In environments that support binary messages (e.g. Celerity runtime in a containerised environment),
a message is expected to be of the following format:

```
<routeLength><route><requireAck><messageIdLength><messageId><message>
```

`<routeLength>` is a 1-byte unsigned integer that represents the length of the route in bytes.

`<route>` is a reserved route key byte or an encoded utf-8 string for the route of the message that is used to route the message to the correct handler, this will be exactly the length specified in `<routeLength>`. A route can not have a length greater than 255 bytes, for performance reasons it is recommended to keep the route as short as possible.

`<requireAck>` is a 1-byte unsigned integer that represents whether the message requires an acknowledgement, this is `0x0` if the message does not require an acknowledgement and `0x1` if the message requires an acknowledgement. This is only taken into account for messages that have a message ID.

`<messageIdLength>` is a 1-byte unsigned integer that represents the length of the message ID in bytes, can be `0` if the message does not have an ID.

`<messageId>` is a unique identifier for the message, this does not have to be set, if message ID length is 0 then the data that follows is expected to the payload of the message. The length of this field is specified in `<messageIdLength>`. A message ID can not have a length greater than 255 bytes, for performance reasons it is recommended to keep the message ID as short as possible.

`<message>` is the actual binary data of the message.

#### Reserved Routes

There are some reserved routes that are used by the Celerity runtime for resilience and reconnection purposes.

- `0x1` - This route is reserved for ping messages.
- `0x2` - This route is reserved for pong messages, these are sent in response to ping messages.
- `0x3` - This route is reserved for messages that are sent from the server to the client to indicate that it could not guarantee that a message was received by other clients in the same session. This will be the case if other clients in the session are unreachable or if an acknowedgement was not received after a certain amount of time from other nodes when the API is running as a cluster of Celerity runtime instances.

    A **_session_** in this context refers to a group of clients that are sharing a real-time experience (e.g. a chat room, a collaborative document editor, etc.). In a service deployed as a cluster of nodes, a session can be distributed across multiple nodes, so the Celerity runtime includes a
    mechanism for broadcasting messages to all nodes in the cluster with a best-effort approach to ensuring that messages are delivered to all clients in the session.
    
    The format of the message body is `{"messageId":"<messageId>","caller":"<caller>"}`. The client SDK will expose an API that will allow applications to handle potentially lost messages in an application-specific way.

- `0x4` - This route is reserved for acknowledging messages.

    The format of the message body is `{"messageId":"<messageId>","timestamp":"<timestamp>"}`.

Due to the lack of a browser-based API for interacting with the WebSocket protocol ping/pong mechanism along with variance in browser implementations for server-sent pings, these concerns are brought up to the Celerity runtime protocol level to allow for more control over reconnection behaviour.

### WebSocket Auth Strategy

There are two strategies for authenticating WebSocket connections: `authMessage` and `connect`.
See the [WebSocket Configuration](#websocketconfiguration) section for the field that determines the strategy.

#### `authMessage` approach

✅ **Available in v0** - The `authMessage` approach is available in v0 as is applicable to AWS API Gateway WebSocket APIs.

On successful connection, the client must send a message with the token in the format:
```json
{
    "event": "authenticate",
    "data": {
        "token": "..."
    }
}
```

_The API's auth guard token source must match the field containing the token in the message. (i.e. `$.data.token`)_

_"event" in this example is using the default routeKey, when you specify a custom route key, that will be used instead._

Upon successful authentication, the client will receive a message with the event `authenticated` in the following form:

```json
{
    "event": "authenticated",
    "data": {
        "success": true,
        "userInfo": {
            "id": "12345",
            "name": "John Doe"
        },
        "message": "Authenticated successfully"
    }
}
```

The `userInfo` field will contain the user information that is returned by the auth guard. For custom auth guards, this will be the result returned by the custom guard handler. For JWT auth guards, this will be an object containing the decoded JWT claims in the `data.userInfo.claims` field.

An example response for when a JWT auth guard is used is shown below:
```json
{
    "event": "authenticated",
    "data": {
        "success": true,
        "userInfo": {
            "claims": {
                "sub": "12345",
                "name": "John Doe"
            }
        },
        "message": "Authenticated successfully"
    }
}
```

Upon failed authentication, the client will receive a message with the event `authenticated` in the following form:

```json
{
    "event": "authenticated",
    "data": {
        "success": false,
        "message": "Authentication failed"
    }
}
```

After sending the failed authentication message, the connection will be closed from the server-side.
The purpose of sending the failed authentication message is to provide a clear reason for failure to the client before closing the connection, this is essential in environments that do not support custom WebSocket status codes.

_the "event" field in the response message is not related to the route key, this will always be event._

#### `connect` approach

🚀 **Planned for v1** - The `connect` approach is planned for v1 as is only applicable to WebSocket APIs deployed as containerised applications hosting the Celerity runtime, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

The HTTP header configured as the API's auth guard token source must be sent in the connection request headers.

For example, if the token source is `$.headers.Authorization`, the client must send the token in the `Authorization` header when connecting.

Upon successful authentication, the connection will be upgraded to WebSockets and the client will be able to send and receive messages.

After upgrading the connection, the server should also send a message to the client with the event `authenticated` in the following format:

```json
{
    "event": "authenticated",
    "data": {
        "success": true,
        "userInfo": {
            "id": "12345",
            "name": "John Doe"
        },
        "message": "Authenticated successfully"
    }
}
```

The `userInfo` field will contain the user information that is returned by the auth guard. For custom auth guards, this will be the result returned by the custom guard handler. For JWT auth guards, this will be an object containing the decoded JWT claims in the `data.userInfo.claims` field.

An example response for when a JWT auth guard is used is shown below:
```json
{
    "event": "authenticated",
    "data": {
        "success": true,
        "userInfo": {
            "claims": {
                "sub": "12345",
                "name": "John Doe"
            }
        },
        "message": "Authenticated successfully"
    }
}
```

Upon failed authentication/authorisation, the connection will be closed with either the custom status code `4001` (Unauthorized) or `4002` (Forbidden). The client should handle these status codes as authentication or authorisation failures respectively.
The custom status codes are in the range reserved for application-specific status codes, see [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.2) for more information.


## Target Environments

### Celerity::1

✅ **Available in v0**

In the Celerity::1 local environment, an API is deployed as a containerised version of the Celerity runtime in Docker.
Links from VPCs to APIs are ignored for this environment as the API is deployed to a local container network on a developer or CI machine.

### AWS

🚀 **Planned for v1** - The AWS deployment target is planned for v1, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

In the AWS environment, APIs are deployed as a containerised version of the Celerity runtime.
Authentication, authorisation and CORS configuration defined for the API is taken care of by the runtime.

APIs can be deployed to [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) or [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) backed by [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) or [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) using [compute configuration](/docs/applications/compute-configuration#aws-configuration-options) that is shared between compute resource types in the app deploy configuration file.

#### ECS

When an API is first deployed to ECS, a new cluster is created for the API.
A service is provisioned within the cluster to run the application.
A public-facing application load balancer is created to route traffic to the service, if you require private access to the API, the load balancer can be configured to be internal.
When domain configuration is provided and the load balancer is public-facing, an [ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) certificate is created for the domain and attached to the load balancer, you will need to verify the domain ownership before the certificate can be used.

The service is deployed with an auto-scaling group that will scale the number of tasks running the API based on the CPU and memory usage of the tasks. The auto-scaling group will scale the desired task count with a minimum of 1 task and a maximum of `N` tasks depending on the [app environment](/docs/cli/app-deploy-configuration#structure).

The default maximum number of tasks is 3 for `development` app environments and 6 for `production` app environments. Deploy configuration can be used to override this behaviour.

If backed by EC2, the auto-scaling group will scale the number instances based on CPU utilisation of the instances with a minimum of 1 instance and a maximum of `N` instances depending on the [app environment](/docs/cli/app-deploy-configuration#structure).

The default maximum number of EC2 instances is 3 for `development` app environments and 6 for `production` app environments. Deploy configuration can be used to override this behaviour.

When it comes to networking, ECS services need to be deployed to VPCs; if a VPC is defined in the blueprint and linked to the API, it will be used, otherwise the default VPC for the account will be used. The load balancer will be placed in the public subnet by default, but can be configured to be placed in a private subnet by setting the `celerity.api.vpc.lbSubnetType` annotation to `private`. The service for the application will be deployed to a public subnet by default, but can be configured to be deployed to a private subnet by setting the `celerity.api.vpc.subnetType` annotation to `private`.
By default, 2 private subnets and 2 public subnets are provisioned for the associated VPC, the subnets are spread across 2 availability zones, the ECS resources that need to be associated with a subnet will be associated with these subnets, honouring the API subnet type defined in the annotations.

The CPU to memory ratio used by default for AWS deployments backed by EC2 is that of the `t3.*` instance family. The auto-scaling launch configuration will use the appropriate instance type based on the requirements of the application, these requirements will be taken from the deploy configuration or derived from the handlers configured for the API. If the requirements can not be derived, a default instance type will be selected. For production app environments, the default instance type will be `t3.medium` with 2 vCPUs and 4GB of memory. For development app environments, the default instance type will be `t3.small` with 2 vCPUs and 2GB of memory.

Fargate-backed ECS deployments use the same CPU to memory ratios allowed for Fargate tasks as per the [task definition parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_size).

If memory and CPU is not defined in the deploy configuration and can not be derived from the handlers, some defaults will be set. 
For an EC2-backed cluster, the task housing the containers that make up the service for the API will be deployed with less than 50 percent of memory and 0.8 vCPUs. Less than half of the memory and CPU is allocated to the EC2 instance to allow for smooth deployments of new versions of the API, this is done by making sure there is enough memory and CPU available to the ECS agent and enough to have two instances of the API running at the same time during deployments.
The exact memory usage values for the defaults would be 1,792MB for production app environments and 870MB for development app environments.

For a Fargate-backed cluster, in production app environments, the task housing the containers for the API will be deployed with 2GB of memory and 1 vCPU. In development app environments, the task for the API will be deployed with 1GB of memory and 0.5 vCPUs.

A sidecar [ADOT collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) container is deployed with the API to collect traces and metrics for the application, this will take up a small portion of the memory and CPU allocated to the API. Traces are only collected when tracing is enabled for the API.

#### EKS

When an API is first deployed to EKS, a new cluster is created for the API unless you specify an existing cluster to use in the deploy configuration.

<Callout title="Using existing clusters" type="warning">
When using an existing cluster, the cluster must be configured in a way that is compatible with the VPC annotations configured for the API as well as the target compute type.
For example, a cluster without a Fargate profile can not be used to deploy an API that is configured to use Fargate. Another example would be a cluster with a node group only associated with public subnets not being compatible with an API with the `celerity.api.vpc.subnetType` annotation set to `private`.
You also need to make sure there is enough memory and CPU allocated for node group instances to run the API in addition to other workloads running in the cluster.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Cost of running on EKS" type="warning">
Running a Celerity application on EKS will often not be the most cost-effective option for APIs with low traffic or applications that are not expected to use a lot of resources. All EKS clusters have a fixed cost of around $72 per month for cluster management (control plane etc.), in addition to the cost of the nodes (VMs) that are used to run the application pods along with cost of the load balancer, data transfer and networking components.
If you are looking for a cost-effective solution for low-traffic/low-load applications on Google Cloud, consider using [Cloud Run](#cloud-run) or switching to a [serverless deployment](#google-cloud-serverless) instead.
</Callout>

The cluster is configured with a private endpoint for the Kubernetes API server by default, this can be overridden in the deploy configuration. (VPC links are required to access the Kubernetes API server with the default configuration)

For an EKS cluster backed by EC2, a node group is configured with auto-scaling configuration to have a minimum size of 2 nodes and a maximum size of 6 nodes by default for production app environments. For development app environments, the minimum size of a node group is 1 with a maximum size of 3 by default. Auto-scaling for the EC2 instances is handled by the [Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler#kubernetes-autoscaler). The instance type configured for node groups is determined by the CPU and memory requirements defined in the deploy configuration or derived from the handlers of the API, if the requirements can not be derived, a default instance type will be selected. For production app environments, the default instance type will be `t3.medium` with 2 vCPUs and 4GB of memory. For development app environments, the default instance type will be `t3.small` with 2 vCPUs and 2GB of memory.

For an EKS cluster backed by Fargate, a [Fargate profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html) is configured to run the API.

The [Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) is used to scale the number of pods running the API based on CPU utilisation and average memory utilisation. In development app environments, the minimum number of pods is set to 1 and the maximum number of pods is set to 3 by default. In production app environments, the minimum number of pods is set to 2 and the maximum number of pods is set to 6 by default. The minimum and maximum number of pods can be overridden in the deploy configuration.

Once the cluster is up and running, Kubernetes services are provisioned to run the application, an Ingress service backed by an application load balancer is created to route traffic to the service, if you require private access to the API, the load balancer can be configured to be internal. When domain configuration is provided and the load balancer is public-facing, an [ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) certificate is created for the domain and attached to the ingress service via annotations, you will need to verify the domain ownership before the certificate can be used.

When it comes to networking, EKS services need to be deployed to VPCs; if a VPC is defined in the blueprint and linked to the API, it will be used, otherwise the default VPC for the account will be used.
The ingress service backed by an application load balancer will be placed in the public subnet by default, but can be configured to be placed in a private subnet by setting the `celerity.api.vpc.lbSubnetType` annotation to `private`.

By default, 2 private subnets and 2 public subnets are provisioned for the associated VPC, the subnets are spread across 2 availability zones. For EC2-backed clusters, the EKS node group will be associated with all 4 subnets when `celerity.api.vpc.subnetType` is set to `public`; when `celerity.api.vpc.subnetType` is set to `private`, the node group will only be associated with the 2 private subnets. The orchestrator will take care of assigning one of the subnets defined for the node group.

For Fargate-backed clusters, the Fargate profile will be associated with the private subnets due to the [limitations with Fargate profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html). For Fargate, the API will be deployed to one of the private subnets associated with the profile. 

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
`celerity.api.vpc.subnetType` has no effect for Fargate-based EKS deployments, the API will always be deployed to a private subnet.
</Callout>

If memory and CPU is not defined in the deploy configuration and can not be derived from the handlers, some defaults will be set. 
For an EC2-backed cluster, the task housing the containers that make up the service for the API will be deployed with less than 50 percent of memory and 0.8 vCPUs. Less than half of the memory and CPU is allocated to the EC2 instance to allow for smooth deployments of new versions of the API, this is done by making sure there is enough memory and CPU available to the Kubernetes agent and enough to have two instances of the API running at the same time during deployments.
The exact memory usage values for the defaults would be 1,792MB for production app environments and 870MB for development app environments.

For a Fargate-backed cluster, in production app environments, the pod for the API will be deployed with 2GB of memory and 0.5 vCPUs. In development app environments, the pod for the API will be deployed with 1GB of memory and 0.5 vCPUs. Fargate has a [fixed set of CPU and memory configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-pod-configuration.html) that can be used.

A sidecar [ADOT collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) container is deployed in the pod with the API to collect traces and metrics for the application, this will take up a small portion of the memory and CPU allocated to the API. Traces are only collected when tracing is enabled for the API.

### AWS Serverless

✅ **Available in v0**

In the AWS Serverless environment, APIs are deployed as Amazon API Gateway REST, WebSocket or HTTP APIs with AWS Lambda for the handlers.

Authorisers are configured in the API Gateway for the JWT auth guards.
Custom auth guards will be deployed as custom authorizers with AWS Lambda housing the custom guard handler. Only RSA-based algorithms are supported when deploying to Amazon API Gateway.

When domain configuration is provided, an [ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) certificate is created for the domain and attached to the API Gateway, you will need to verify the domain ownership before the certificate can be used.

When tracing is enabled, an [ADOT lambda layer](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda) is bundled with and configured to instrument each handler to collect traces and metrics.
AWS API Gateway traces are collected in AWS X-Ray, API Gateway-specific traces can be collected into tools like Grafana with plugins that use AWS X-Ray as a data source.

### Google Cloud

🚀 **Planned for v1** - The Google Cloud deployment target is planned for v1, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

In the Google Cloud environment, APIs are deployed as a containerised version of the Celerity runtime.
Authentication, authorisation and CORS configuration defined for the API is taken care of by the runtime.

APIs can be deployed to [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), as well as [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) in [Autopilot](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview) or [Standard](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-regional-cluster) mode.
You can use [compute configuration](/docs/applications/compute-configuration#google-cloud-configuration-options) shared between compute resource types in the app deploy configuration file to fine-tune the compute configuration for your application.

#### Cloud Run

Cloud Run is a relatively simple environment to deploy applications to, the API is deployed as a containerised application that is fronted by either an internal or external load balancer.

Autoscaling is configured with the use of Cloud Run annotations through `autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale` and `autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale` [annotations](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/rest/v1/ObjectMeta). The knative autoscaler will scale the number of instances based on the number of requests and the CPU and memory usage of the instances. By default, for production app environments, the application will be configured to scale the number of instances with a minimum of 2 instance and a maximum of 5 instances. The default values for development app environments are a minimum of 1 instance and a maximum of 3 instances. Deploy configuration can be used to override this behaviour.

When domain configuration is provided and the load balancer is public-facing and Google-managed, a [managed TLS certificate](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates) is created for the domain and attached to the load balancer, you will need to verify the domain ownership before the certificate can be used.

For Cloud Run, the API will not be associated with a VPC, defining custom VPCs for Cloud Run applications is not supported. Creating and linking a VPC to the API will enable the `Internal` networking mode in the [network ingress settings](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/ingress). `celerity.api.vpc.subnetType` has no effect for Cloud Run deployments, the API will always be deployed to a network managed by Google Cloud. Setting `celerity.api.vpc.lbSubnetType` to `private` will have the same affect as attaching a VPC to the application, making the application load balancer private. Setting `celerity.api.vpc.lbSubnetType` to `public` will have the same effect as not attaching a VPC to the API, making the application load balancer public. `public` is equivalent to the "Internal and Cloud Load Balancing" [ingress setting](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/ingress#settings).

Memory and CPU resources allocated to the API can be defined in the deploy configuration, when not defined, memory and CPU will be derived from the handlers configured for the API.
If memory and CPU is not defined in the deploy configuration and can not be derived from the handlers, some defaults will be set. The Cloud Run service will be allocated a limit of 2GB of memory and 1 vCPU per instance in production app environments. For development app environments, the service will be allocated a limit of 1GB of memory and 0.5 vCPUs per instance.

A sidecar [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/opentelemetry-cloud-run) container is deployed in the service with the API to collect traces and metrics, this will take up a small portion of the memory and CPU allocated to the API. Traces will only be collected if tracing is enabled for the API.

#### GKE

When an API is first deployed to GKE, a new cluster is created for the API unless you specify an existing cluster to use in the deploy configuration.

<Callout title="Using existing clusters" type="warning">
When using an existing cluster, the cluster must be configured in a way that is compatible with the VPC annotations configured for the API as well as the target compute type.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Cost of running on GKE" type="warning">
Running a Celerity application on GKE will often not be the most cost-effective option for APIs with low traffic or applications that are not expected to use a lot of resources. All GKE clusters have a fixed cost of around $72 per month for cluster management (control plane etc.), in addition to the cost of the nodes (VMs) that are used to run the application pods along with cost of the load balancer, data transfer and networking components.
If you are looking for a cost-effective solution for low-traffic/low-load applications on Google Cloud, consider using [Cloud Run](#cloud-run) or switching to a [serverless deployment](#google-cloud-serverless) instead.
</Callout>

When in standard mode, for production app environments, the cluster will be regional with 2 zones for better availability guarantees. A node pool is created with autoscaling enabled, by default, for production app environments, the pool will have a minimum of 1 node and a maximum of 3 nodes per zone. As the cluster has 2 zones, this will be a minimum of 2 nodes and a maximum of 6 nodes overall. The [cluster autoscaler](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-autoscaler) is used to manage scaling and choosing the appropriate instance type to use given the requirements of the API service. For development app environments, the cluster will be regional with 1 zone. The node pool will have a minimum of 1 node and a maximum of 3 nodes in the single zone for development app environments. The minimum and maximum number of nodes can be overridden in the deploy configuration.

For standard mode, the machine type configured for node pools is determined by the CPU and memory requirements defined in the deploy configuration or derived from the handlers of the API, if the requirements can not be derived, a default machine type will be selected. For production app environments, the default machine type will be `n2-highcpu-4` with 4 vCPUs and 4GB of memory. For development app environments, the default machine type will be `n1-highcpu-2` with 2 vCPUs and 2GB of memory. The machine type for node pools can be overridden in the deploy configuration.

When in autopilot mode, Google manages scaling, security and node pools. Based on memory and CPU limits applied at the pod-level, appropriate node instance types will be selected and will be scaled automatically. There is no manual autoscaling configuration when running in autopilot mode, GKE Autopilot is priced per pod request rather than provisioned infrastructure, depending on the nature of your workloads, it could be both a cost-effective and convenient way to run your APIs. [Read more about autopilot mode pricing](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/pricing#autopilot_mode).

In standard mode, the [Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) is used to scale the number of pods running the API based on CPU utilisation and average memory utilisation. In development app environments, the minimum number of pods is set to 1 and the maximum number of pods is set to 3 by default. In production app environments, the minimum number of pods is set to 2 and the maximum number of pods is set to 6 by default. The minimum and maximum number of pods can be overridden in the deploy configuration.

When domain configuration is provided and the load balancer that powers the Ingress service is public-facing and Google-managed, a [managed TLS certificate](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/managed-certs) is created for the domain and attached to the Ingress object, you will need to verify the domain ownership before the certificate can be used.

When it comes to networking, a GKE cluster is deployed as a [private cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/private-cluster-concept), nodes that the pods for the API run on only use internal IP addresses, isolating them from the public internet. The Control plane has both internal and external endpoints, the external endpoint can be disabled from the Google Cloud/Kubernetes side. When `celerity.api.vpc.lbSubnetType` is set to `public`, an [Ingress](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress) service is provisioned using an external Application Load Balancer. When `celerity.api.vpc.lbSubnetType` is set to `private`, an Ingress service is provisioned using an internal Application Load Balancer. The Ingress service is used to route traffic from the public internet to the service running the API.

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
`celerity.api.vpc.subnetType` has no effect for GKE clusters, the API will always be deployed to a private network, the API is exposed through the ingress service if the ingress is configured to be public.
</Callout>

If memory and CPU is not defined in the deploy configuration and can not be derived from the handlers, some defaults will be set. Limits of 1,792MB of memory and 1.6 vCPUs will be set for the pods that run the API in production app environments. For development app environments, the pods will be deployed with 870MB of memory and 0.8 vCPUs.

The [OpenTelemetry Operator](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/easy-telemetry-instrumentation-gke-opentelemetry-operator/) is used to configure a sidecar collector container for the API to collect traces and metrics. Traces will only be collected if tracing is enabled for the API.

### Google Cloud Serverless

🚀 **Planned for v1** - The Google Cloud Serverless deployment target is planned for v1, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

In the Google Cloud Serverless environment, REST/HTTP APIs are deployed as Google Cloud API Gateways with Google Cloud Functions for the handlers.

[JWT authentication](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway/docs/authenticating-users-jwt) for API Gateway is used for JWT auth guards. Only the RSA using SHA-256 (RS256) algorithm is supported when deploying to Google Cloud API Gateway.

Custom authorisers are not supported by Google Cloud API Gateway; to get around this, Celerity will bundle the custom authoriser handler code with each protected handler and the handlers SDK that is used to build a Celerity application will take care of calling the custom authoriser before the actual handler is called.

When tracing is enabled, the built-in Google Cloud metrics and tracing offerings will be used to collect traces and metrics for the handlers. Traces and metrics can be collected into tools like Grafana with plugins that use Google Cloud Trace as a data source. Logs and metrics are captured out of the box for the API Gateway and will be collected in Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring. You can export logs and metrics to other tools like Grafana with plugins that use Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring as a data source.

<Callout title="Tracing in Google Cloud Serverless" type="warning">
Google Cloud API Gateway does not currently support tracing.
</Callout>

<Callout title="About WebSockets" type="warning">
Google Cloud API Gateway does not support WebSocket APIs.
To deploy a WebSockets API to Google Cloud, you will need to use the "[Google Cloud](#google-cloud)" target environment and deploy the API as a containerised application.
</Callout>

### Azure

🚀 **Planned for v1** - The Azure deployment target is planned for v1, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

In the Azure environment, APIs are deployed as a containerised version of the Celerity runtime.
Authentication, authorisation and CORS configuration defined for the API is taken care of by the runtime.

APIs can be deployed to [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps/) or [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service). You can use [compute configuration](/docs/applications/compute-configuration#azure-configuration-options) shared between compute resource types in the app deploy configuration file to fine-tune the compute configuration for your application.

#### Container Apps

Container Apps is a relatively simple environment to deploy applications to, the API is deployed as a containerised application that is fronted by either external HTTPS ingress or internal ingress.

Autoscaling is determined based on the number of concurrent HTTP requests for public APIs, for private APIs and hybrid applications (e.g. API and message processor) [KEDA-supported](https://keda.sh/docs/2.15/scalers/) CPU and memory scaling triggers are used. By default, in production app environments, the [scale definition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/scale-app?pivots=azure-cli#scale-definition) is set to scale from 2 to 5 replicas per revision. For development app environments, the default scale definition is set to scale from 1 to 3 replicas per revision. The minimum and maximum number of replicas can be overridden in the deploy configuration.

When domain configuration is provided and the API is configured to be public-facing, a [managed TLS certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/custom-domains-managed-certificates?pivots=azure-portal) is provisioned and attached to the Container App's HTTP ingress configuration. You will need to verify the domain ownership before the certificate can be used. 

Container Apps will not be associated with a private network by default, a VNet is automatically generated for you and generated VNets are publicly accessible over the internet. [Read about networking for Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli). When you define a VPC and link it to the API, a custom VNet will be provisioned and the API will be deployed to either a private or public subnet based on the `celerity.api.vpc.subnetType` annotation, defaulting to a public subnet if not specified. When the `celerity.api.vpc.lbSubnetType` is set to `public`, a public HTTPS ingress is provisioned for the API; when set to `private`, an internal HTTP ingress is provisioned for the API. Azure's built-in [zone redundancy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/reliability-azure-container-apps?tabs=azure-cli) is used to ensure high availability of the API.

Memory and CPU resources allocated to the API can be defined in the deploy configuration, when not defined, memory and CPU will be derived from the handlers configured for the API. If memory and CPU is not defined in the deploy configuration and can not be derived from the handlers, some defaults will be set. For production app environments, the Container App service will be allocated a limit of 2GB of memory and 1 vCPU per instance in the consumption plan, [see allocation requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/containers#allocations).
For development app environments, the Container App service will be allocated a limit of 1GB of memory and 0.5 vCPUs per instance in the consumption plan.

The [OpenTelemetry Data Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/opentelemetry-agents?tabs=arm) is used to collect traces and metrics for the application. Traces will only be collected if tracing is enabled for the API.

#### AKS

When an API is first deployed to AKS, a new cluster is created for the API unless you specify an existing cluster to use in the deploy configuration.

<Callout title="Using existing clusters" type="warning">
When using an existing cluster, it must be configured in a way that is compatible with the VPC annotations configured for the API as well as the target compute type.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Cost of running on AKS" type="warning">
Running a Celerity application on AKS will often not be the most cost-effective option for APIs with low traffic or applications that are not expected to use a lot of resources. The default configuration uses instances that meet the minimum requirements to run Kubernetes in AKS that will cost hundreds of US dollars a month to run.
If you are looking for a cost-effective solution for low-traffic/low-load applications on Azure, consider using [Azure Container Apps](#container-apps) instead.
</Callout>

The cluster is created across 2 availability zones for better availability guarantees. Best effort zone balancing is used with [Azure VM Scale Sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones?tabs=portal-2#zone-balancing). 2 separate node pools will be configured for the cluster, 1 for the Kubernetes system components and 1 for your application. When using an existing cluster, a new node pool will be created specifically for this application.

The cluster is configured with an [autoscaler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-autoscaler?tabs=azure-cli) for each node pool. For production app environments, by default, the autoscaler for the application node pool will be configured with a minimum of 3 nodes and a maximum of 6 nodes
distributed across availability zones as per Azure's zone balancing. For development app environments, the autoscaler for the application node pool will be configured with a minimum of 1 node and a maximum of 3 nodes by default.

The autoscaler for the system node pool will be configured with a minimum of 2 nodes and a maximum of 3 nodes for production app environments. For development app environments, the autoscaler for the system node pool will be configured with a minimum of 1 node and a maximum of 2 nodes by default.

For both production and development app environments, the default node size for the system node pool is `Standard_D4d_v5` with 4 vCPUs and 16GB of memory. This size has been chosen because of the [minimum requirements for system Node Pools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-system-pools?tabs=azure-cli#system-and-user-node-pools).
For the application node pool, the default node size differs based on the app environment. For production app environments, the default node size is `Standard_D4ls_v6` with 4 vCPUs and 8GB of memory. For development app environments, the default node size is `Standard_D2ls_v6` with 2 vCPUs and 4GB of memory.
If the CPU or memory requirements of the API defined in the app blueprint cause the default node size to not be able to comfortably run 2 instances of the API, a larger node size will be selected.
Min and max node count along with the node size for both system and application node pools can be overridden in the deploy configuration.

The [Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) is used to scale the number of pods running the API based on CPU utilisation and average memory utilisation. In development app environments, the minimum number of pods is set to 1 and the maximum number of pods is set to 6 by default. In production app environments, the minimum number of pods is set to 2 and the maximum number of pods is set to 12 by default. The minimum and maximum number of pods can be overridden in the deploy configuration.

When domain configuration is provided and the load balancer that powers the Ingress service is public-facing, a TLS certificate is generated with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) via [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/) to provision certificates for domains associated with Ingress resources in Kubernetes. The certificate is used by the Ingress object to terminate TLS traffic. You will need to verify the domain ownership before the certificate can be used.

When it comes to networking, the API will be deployed with the overlay network model in a public network as per the default AKS access mode. [Read about private and public clusters for AKS](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/public-and-private-aks-clusters-demystified/ba-p/3716838).
When you define a VPC and link it to the API, the API will be deployed as a private cluster using the VNET integration feature of AKS where the control plane will not be made available through a public endpoint. The `celerity.api.vpc.subnetType` annotation has **no** effect for AKS deployments as the networking model for Azure with it's managed Kubernetes offering is different from other cloud providers and all services running on a cluster are private by default, exposed to the internet through a load balancer or ingress controller. When `celerity.api.vpc.lbSubnetType` is set to `public`, an Ingress service is provisioned using the [nginx ingress controller](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing) that uses an external Azure Load Balancer under the hood. When `celerity.api.vpc.lbSubnetType` is set to `private`, the nginx Ingress controller is configured to use an internal Azure Load Balancer, [read more about the private ingress controller](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/create-nginx-ingress-private-controller).

Memory and CPU resources allocated to the API pod can be defined in the deploy configuration, if not specified, the API will derive memory and CPU from handlers configured for the API.
If memory and CPU is not defined in the deploy configuration and can not be derived from the handlers, some defaults will be set. For production app environments, the pod that runs the API will be allocated a limit of 1,792MB of memory and 0.8 vCPUs. For development app environments, the pod that runs the API will be allocated a limit of 870MB of memory and 0.4 vCPUs.

The [OpenTelemetry Operator](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/) is used to configure a sidecar collector container for the API to collect traces and metrics. Traces will only be collected if tracing is enabled for the API.

### Azure Serverless

🚀 **Planned for v1** - The Azure Serverless deployment target is planned for v1, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

In the Azure Serverless environment, REST/HTTP APIs are deployed as Azure API Management APIs with Azure Functions for the handlers.

[JWT authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/validate-jwt-policy) for API Management Gateways is used for JWT auth guards. The supported asymmetric signing algorithms are PS256, RS256, RS612 and ES256. The Celerity API implementation deployed to Azure API Management only supports the [openid configuration approach](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/validate-jwt-policy#elements) that uses a JWKS that provides the public key parts for a set of asymmetric keys.

Custom authorisers are not supported by Azure API Management; to get around this, Celerity will bundle the custom authoriser handler code with each protected handler and the handlers SDK that is used to build a Celerity application will take care of calling the custom authoriser before the actual handler is called.

When tracing is enabled, the [trace policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/trace-policy) is used for the API Management Gateway, these traces will go to Application Insights. You can export logs, traces and metrics to other tools like Grafana with plugins that use Azure Monitor as a data source.
When it comes to the Azure Functions that power the endpoints, traces and metrics go to Application Insights by default, from which you can export logs, traces and metrics to other tools like Grafana with plugins that use Azure Monitor as a data source.
[OpenTelemetry for Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/opentelemetry-howto?tabs=otlp-export&pivots=programming-language-csharp) is also supported for some languages, you can use the deploy configuration to enable OpenTelemetry for Azure Functions.

<Callout title="About WebSockets" type="warning">
Azure API Management does not support WebSocket APIs natively, WebSocket APIs can be used as the backend server but do not get the benefits of the API Management features such as authentication.
</Callout>


## App Deploy Configuration

Configuration specific to a target environment can be defined for `celerity/api` resources in the [app deploy configuration](/docs/cli/app-deploy-configuration) file.

This section lists the configuration options that can be set in the `deployTarget.config` object in the app deploy configuration file.

### Compute Configuration

Compute configuration that can be used for the `celerity/api`, `celerity/consumer`, `celerity/schedule` and `celerity/workflow` resource types is documented [here](/docs/applications/compute-configuration).

### Azure Configuration Options

🚀 **Planned for v1** - The Azure deployment targets are planned for v1, it may become available in a future v0 evolution.

#### azure.serverless.functions.otel

When set to `true`, OpenTelemetry will be enabled for Azure Functions. This feature is currently in preview (May 2025) and is only supported for a subset of languages.
See the [OpenTelemetry for Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/opentelemetry-howto?tabs=otlp-export&pivots=programming-language-csharp) documentation for more information.
This is used when deploying to the `azure-serverless` target environment. 

**Type**

boolean

**Default Value**

`false`

## JWT Support in the Celerity Runtime

When you deploy a Celerity application to a containerised (or VM-based) target environment, the Celerity runtime will be used to run the application. The Celerity runtime will be responsible for validating the JWTs when an API is configured with JWT auth guards.

The Celerity runtime does not have exact parity with the JWT support in serverless target environments, the runtime has more capabilities than the equivalent serverless target environments.

The Celerity runtime supports the following features for JWT validation:

- OpenID Connect (OIDC) discovery to retrieve the JWKS (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`)
- OAuth2 discovery to retrieve the JWKS (`/.well-known/oauth-authorizaton-server`)
- Multiple asymmetric signing algorithms compatible with JSON Web Key Sets (RS256, RS384, RS512, PS256, ES256, ES384, EdDSA).

## ⚠️ Limitations

There are limitations when it comes to deploying a `celerity/api` in Serverless environments. Only Amazon API Gateway supports the WebSocket protocol when opting for an architecture where handlers are deployed as serverless functions (e.g. AWS Lambda).
Azure and Google Cloud do not have an equivalent for WebSocket APIs in their Serverless API Gateway/Management offerings.

Azure API Management supports WebSocket APIs where the upstream backend is itself a WebSocket server. In this situation, you would have a Celerity runtime instance as your backend WebSocket server. Celerity **_does not_** manage this for you. You would need to setup and manage your own Azure API Management instance and configure the Celerity WebSocket API as the backend server.

[^1]: Examples of Serverless API Gateways include [Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html), [Google Cloud API Gateway](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway), and [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts).
